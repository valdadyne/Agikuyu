            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>Kikuyus are believed to have come from West Africa along with other Bantu tribes. They finally settled along Mount Kenya where they began their main activity of farming the fertile volcanic highlands.</p>
            <p>Kikuyus were good friends with the Maasai and the two tribes often traded goods and inter-married. However, when the British came to Nairobi, they confiscated some of the Kikuyus' fertile land, leaving them with only a small piece to cultivate.</p>
            <p> Frustrated with the loss of their land and the colonial rule, the Kikuyus formed a rebellion group, the Mau Mau, and entered into war with the British. This war eventually led to Kenya's independence.</p>
            <p>Although many Kikuyus have migrated to the main urban city of Nairobi and other towns, their territories still remain along Mount Kenya and the central highlands, including Nyeri, Muranga, Kiambu, and Kirinyaga regions of Kenya.</p>

            <h3>Culture</h3>
              <b>Kikuyu Food</b>
              <p>In most rural Kikuyu homes, typical traditional Kikuyu food includes githeri (maize and beans), mukimo (mashed green peas and potatoes), irio (mashed dry beans, corn and potatoes), roast goat, beef, chicken and cooked green vegetables such as collards, spinach and carrots..</p>

              <b>Kikuyu faith and religion</b>
              <p>Today, most Kikuyus are Christians, however, like the Maasai and Kamba tribes, Kikuyus traditionally worshipped a single god, Ngai, who was known as the provider and lived at the top of the mountain. Kikuyus believed it was their traditional god who started the Kikuyu tribe by putting on earth a man and woman named Kikuyu and Mumbi. The couple had nine daughters who later married and brought the Kikuyu tribe to life.</p>

              <b>Kikuyu Music</b>
              <p>Traditionaly Hard worked alternated with fun and enjoyment. In most cases work itself was fun because people sang and talked as they worked in their shambas and they had time during the working hours to roast maize, sweet potatoes or bananas. If beer was being brewed, the men were called out to cut the sugar cane, the women to carry and thrash it and the children to eat the remaining, unusable pieces of it. When the beer was ready, it was drank by all.</p>
              <p>With the widespread embrace of Christianity, traditional Kikuyu music and dance is pretty much extinct. Modern Kikuyu music (pop, dance, Gospel) is very popular. Most famously is the <i>Mugithi</i></p>
              <p>Popular Kikuyu musicians include Joseph Kamaru, DK Kamau, Wanganangu, HM, D'mathew, Peter Kiggia, Mike Rua and Salim Junior.</p>
